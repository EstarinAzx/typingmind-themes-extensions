# XML Tag Creator

I've developed a TypingMind plugin designed to simplify adding XML tags when pasting code. You can easily paste code into a popup box, which automatically generates XML tags and labels them based on the programming language. As you may know, when coding with Claude wrapping code in xml tags is crucial to ensure the best output from the AI. 

This plugin is ideal for anyone tired of manually adding XML tags when pasting code.

### Installation
Add this URL to your TypingMind extensions:
```

```

## How it Works

1. Click the "Insert Code" button which is after the Microphone icon in the text input box
2. A popup window appears
3. Paste your code into the text box
4. Click "Insert Code" to insert it into your message
5. The plugin detects the programming language and wraps your code in XML tags
6. The formatted code is added right where your cursor is positioned
